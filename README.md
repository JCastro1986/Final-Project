# Project Ideas

1. Precios de la canasta básica.
2. Comportamiento de la cartera.
3. Analysis on House & Flat Prices (Winner)

# Project Descrption

1. Create a model using supervised machine learning to predict prices of houses & flats in an specific state located in Mexico based on data scrapped from the web.
2. The model will work on a target prices based on our data to project the price of a house or flat based on the user preferences.
  a) We will be having a comparason based on real prices to make an analysis and provide an under valued or over valued pirce of the house or flat.
4. Make a clear and friendly visualizatoin unsing logitutes and latitudes to better present results using different filters such as:
  a) State location, Neighborhood, Type of hosehold, size(m2), number of rooms, etc. 

*ADVICE*
- Prepare our code to ensure what are we looking for.
- Webscrapping for data.
- What is my question? make a decision ans chose one and only one.
- Best state to buy houses, where are most under/over valued houses, it is important to know if a house is under/over valued, the model needs to tell a story, etc.
- The prediction has to be well stablished, need good data to answer the question.
- Go far.

**MACHINE LEARNING**


Team members present a provisional
machine learning model that stands in
for the final machine learning model
and accomplishes the following:
✓ Takes in data in from the provisional
database
✓ Outputs label(s) for input data

**BASE DE DATOS**


Team members present a provisional
database that stands in for the final
database and accomplishes the
following:
✓ Sample data that mimics the
expected final database structure or
schema
✓ Draft machine learning module is
connected to the provisional database

**TECHNOLOGY**

The team will be using supervised machine learning
to target the price of house and flats, based on 
data obatined from Webscrapping.
